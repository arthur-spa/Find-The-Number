# Find-The-Number :rocket: 

Very simple python program.Play to the "Find the number" game.

The program take a random number between 1 and 100. Then, you'll have to find it. If you're above or under, he'll tell you. That's the game ! 

Feel free to use, modify it. If the code is not optimized, that's normal : I'm a beginer. Feel free to post a request for any optimisations !

Hope you'll enjoy it.
